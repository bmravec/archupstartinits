These are sample files for use in arch linux for the upstart init daemon.

As it currently stands some paths are hard wired into the scripts so if you
install upstart into it's own directory like /opt/upstart, the paths will have
to be corrected.  The main example is for telinit.  Upstart ships a different
version and the upstart version is needed for it to work correctly.

It accepts a runlevel via options passed at boot time.  The default runlevel is
3.  In that mode it starts dbus, hal, and acpid and starts tty1 and tty2.  The
other useful option is 5.  This will start everything like 3 does, but then it
starts gdm.

All this work is still very hackish, but it shows a lot of promise for boot
speed.  Currently just the basics work in archlinux.  If certain applications
are not installed, disable the scripts by changing the extension.  Also some of
the other files might have to be changed to reflect the missing script.
